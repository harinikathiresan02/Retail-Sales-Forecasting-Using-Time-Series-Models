# Retail-Sales-Forecasting-Using-Time-Series-Models
This project forecasts daily retail sales using ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, and LSTM. Based on the M5 dataset, it compares models to predict product-level sales for better inventory planning. LSTM outperformed others with the highest RÂ² score and lowest error.
